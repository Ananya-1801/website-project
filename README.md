# 🌐 Interactive Static Website Project

**A responsive and interactive front-end website built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.**  
This project shows my ability to create a clean user interface, navigation structure, and responsive design elements for web users.

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the complete source code for a static website featuring:

- A responsive homepage
- Navigation menu
- Structured sections (About, Health, Workout, Feedback)

Though some initial development and design work happened outside GitHub, the entire codebase is now hosted here for collaboration, showcasing, and version tracking.
